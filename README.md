This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMatch-Yang%2Feasy_token_nextjs&env=ZEGOCLOUD_APP_ID,ZEGOCLOUD_SERVER_SECRET,FA_PROJECT_ID,FA_PRIVATE_KEY_ID,FA_PRIVATE_KEY,FA_CLIENT_EMAIL,FA_CLIENT_ID,FA_CLIENT_X509_CERT_URL&envDescription=You%20shoud%20set%20all%20the%20environment%20variables%20proply%20to%20make%20it%20work&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMatch-Yang%2Feasy_token_nextjs%2Fblob%2Fmain%2FEnvironmentVariable.md)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
